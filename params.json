It wasn't really the internet, but we didn't know any better then.\r\n\r\nBBSes often offered what were called [\"door games\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBS_door), which were swappable external text-based games that users could play. (Remember, these were in the days when a single image could take 5-10 minutes to load on you 2400-baud modem.) They were awesome. And when I was in middle school, I was fascinated with one game in particular: Seth Robinson's **\"Legend of the Red Dragon\"** (LORD). It was, not surprisingly, one of the most popular door games of all time.\r\n\r\nMy fascination with LORD led me and a buddy, then also about 15, to build our own BBS from scratch. We built a computer, bought some software, learned some basic code and made it a thing. It was the first thing I programmed and built. I now work in enterprise software, and I credit our BBS, and LORD, for being one of the sparks for everything that came afterwards. A game literally kind of changed my life.\r\n\r\nLORD, like the BBSes it ran on, is now long-gone, and has mostly been forgotten. So when I began experimenting with Meteor and Node development and was thinking about a project to work on, building a LORD for the modern web was what I landed on. Slack provides a perfect runtime for a text-based game, and gave me an opportunity to build my first chatbot.\r\n\r\nThis is all very much a WIP, and your comments/suggestions/etc are welcome. I don't really know what I'm doing.\r\n\r\n###Why the name Coneshire?\r\nBecause [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfXfOCIIFcY) was pretty much my wife's reaction too.\r\n\r\n###Privacy Policy\r\nLotPD does not collect any private information from you, and nor do I want it. The only thing this bot collects is your Slack user ID, which is required to save your unique gameplay history, and your username. **I do not collect email addresses, real names, addresses, or anything of that sort.** Your Slack user ID will be shared with no one.\r\n\r\n###Contact me\r\nEmail: sysop@dunshirecones.com\r\n\r\n[Twitterwebs](https://twitter.com/blairreeves)",
