<h2>What's this all about?</h2>

Legend of the Plaid Dragon is a text-based role-playing game for Slack, based loosely on the BBS door game classic [Legend of the Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon). Players can develop a character, interact with other characters, pursue mysteries and, of course, slay beasts and level up so they can... slay even **bigger** monsters, and eventually defeat the Plaid Dragon, who terrorizes the mystical village.

**This game is still very much in beta.** Give me a holler about bugs you encounter - there are plenty of them still out there.

**Updated:** I have removed this app from the Slack App Directory and have taken it offline until further notice.

<h3>Privacy</h3>

The permission scopes for this game are very narrowly drawn, and I don't save anything that I don't absolutely have to in order for the game to work. Specifically, I keep your team ID, Slack user ID and user name.
