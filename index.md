###Welcome to Legend of the Plaid Dragon.

This project has been taken offline for upgrades and revisions. But don't worry - LotPD will be back.

###What's this all about?

Legend of the Plaid Dragon is a text-based role-playing game for Slack, the web, and maybe other platforms, where players develop a character, slay beasts and level up so they can... slay bigger monsters, and eventually defeat the Plaid Dragon, who terrorizes the mystical village of Coneshire.
