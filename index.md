###What's this all about?

Legend of the Plaid Dragon is a text-based role-playing game for Slack, based loosely on the BBS door game classic [Legend of the Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon). Players can develop a character, interact with other characters, pursue mysteries and, of course, slay beasts and level up so they can... slay even **bigger** monsters, and eventually defeat the Plaid Dragon, who terrorizes the mystical village.
