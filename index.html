<p>Legend of the Plaid Dragon is a text-based role-playing game where players develop a character, slay beasts and level up so they can... slay bigger monsters, and eventually defeat the Plaid Dragon, who terrorizes the mystical village of Coneshire.</p>

<p>You can invite the LotPD bot into your Slack with the button below, or <a href="http://www.dunshirecones.com">play it directly on the web.</a></p>

<p><strong>First, some history:</strong> way back in the bad old days, before everyone had high-speed internet and supercomputers in their pockets, even before generational landmarks like AOL or CompuServe really got big, people used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">"bulletin board systems"</a> - BBSes - to do their interneting. It wasn't really the internet, but we didn't know any better then.</p>

<p>BBSes often offered what were called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBS_door">"door games"</a>, which were swappable external text-based games that users could play. (Remember, these were in the days when a single image could take 5-10 minutes to load on you 2400-baud modem.) They were awesome. And when I was in middle school, I was fascinated with one game in particular: Seth Robinson's <strong>"Legend of the Red Dragon"</strong> (LORD). It was, not surprisingly, one of the most popular door games of all time.</p>

<p>My fascination with LORD led me and a buddy, then also about 15, to build our own BBS from scratch. We built a computer, bought some software, learned some basic code and made it a thing. It was the first thing I programmed and built. I now work in enterprise software, and I credit our BBS, and LORD, for being one of the sparks for everything that came afterwards. A game literally kind of changed my life.</p>

<p>LORD, like the BBSes it ran on, is now long-gone, and has mostly been forgotten. So when I began experimenting with Meteor and Node development and was thinking about a project to work on, building a LORD for the modern web was what I landed on. Slack provides a perfect runtime for a text-based game, and gave me an opportunity to build my first chatbot.</p>

<p>This is all very much a WIP, and your comments/suggestions/etc are welcome. I don't really know what I'm doing.</p>
